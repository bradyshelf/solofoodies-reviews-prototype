## **🧭 Design Principles**

1. **Mobile-First:** Prioritize thumb-friendly navigation and fluid scroll-based layouts. Use consistent tab bar UI at the bottom.  
2. **Clean & Visual:** Emphasize whitespace, large images, and typography to create a modern, airy aesthetic.  
3. **Creator-Friendly:** Use playful elements, profile-centric layouts, and vibrant highlights to resonate with influencer culture.  
4. **Trust & Clarity:** Make all collaboration terms and approvals visually distinct with icons, chips, and confirmation steps.  
5. **Accessibility:** Ensure high contrast ratios, readable fonts, and scalable layouts across devices.

  * Location \+ Restaurant Name  
  * Party Size / Value Tags

* Rounded, pill-style chips for tags (e.g. "Public", "Private", "Free Meal")  
* Primary buttons in orange, secondary in green or gray

### **✅ Status Indicators**

* **Copywriting Tips:**  
  * Use action-oriented labels ("Request Collab", "View Details")

## **🔁 Reusability**

* Maintain design tokens for color, spacing, and typography  
* Stick to 8pt spacing system

* Share design tokens with dev team via Figma variables or Tailwind config  
* Ensure all states (hover, active, disabled) are documented
